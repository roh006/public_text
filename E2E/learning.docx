===================================================================================================
Well, research shows that strong communication is the cornerstone for thriving businesses, healthy relationships, and your career success.

 Before communicating, consider each of these four building blocks. As you walk to your next meeting, think to yourself, 
People --> "Who will be there? What do I need to know about them?
 Listener--> What kind of listener do I want to be right now?"
Context -->  Before you hit Send on your next email, ask yourself, "How's the timing of this email? 
Message -->Is email appropriate, or should I pop in for a quick chat?" 


Think--> Feel --> do 

" Communication gets tricky because all people have mental filters, certain levels of knowledge, personal concerns, or preconceived notions

Social setting 
 Yet working lunches, moments before meetings and water cooler chats are a great opportunity to build rapport and cultivate trust

 Minimize fidgeting. Stillness means calmness. Practice being quiet with your gestures and your face. You want to be expressive, but don't overdo it
Prepare Meeting 
plan to share three things that went well and three things that we could have done better on the project, 10 minutes. Adding that estimated time for each agenda item will help people mentally prepare

When you run a meeting, you want to stimulate discussion.

Let's shift gears. What could we have done even better? Jake, do you have a thought? 

I don't want to put you on the spot, but I do want to give you the floor if you have anything that you wanted to add

 "John, what are your ideas?
For example, "John, did you want to say something?
 

If someone interrupts say, "Hold that thought, please

it looks as though maybe you disagree. I'd like to hear your thoughts."




Toolkit Meeting plan
These new actions might happen before the meeting even takes place. For example, you could send an agenda with ways people can prepare and a timeframe for each item, or you could spend time planning the questions you will ask to spark a great discussion. 

. Or hold the floor for people if others try to interrupt.

 Demonstrate good listening by summarizing periodically in your own words


==================================================
When you send emails

said she likes her email like her dentist visits, short, to the point and only when necessary.

Talk about some best practices for writing emails that get action. When crafting an email, begin by thinking of the action you need the reader to take, make sure that action request ends up being in your first or second sentence.

 She also needs to edit for tone and accuracy.

to protect your credibility. To be a great proofreader, adjust your mindset so that you want to find errors. When we're eager to hit send, our minds skim right over mistakes
=========================================

When you are explaining

Follow the what, why, how logic
the process and tell your learner why the task matters. Let the learner show and tell. After you demonstrate a process, ask the learner to show and tell back to you. Avoid the temptation to grab the mouse or jump in and correct when they are explaining their thinking. Learners need to practice in a safe environment that you create. Don't cheat them of that experience. Want some help applying these skills to your daily life?

	•  Find out how they process information first. Ask each, 
	• "Do you need to see a picture of the final product?
	•  Do you prefer a step-by-step recipe? 
	• Do you need a list of ingredients first?" 
	• From this information, identify the big picture people and the step-by-step people. How would you teach each group how to cook the meal?

 Make a list of your instructions. Share it with them and get their feedback. In our second activity, you can work on breaking down a process. Now, think of a process that your team members do often. List all of the steps that need to happen from start to finish. Break that list into separate buckets.
think of what u need to explain 
Write down "what" in one senetence 
List three reason the "Why"
Write down the steps "the "How"
Practice with a friend 

	•  Try to capture the big picture. Now, make a list of three reasons
	•  why this is a good idea and why this task matters.
	•  Then proceed to the how, the buckets, and the steps involved. Practice this with a friend before you share it in a meeting. Ask your friends to paraphrase back what they have heard. 
	• Do you need to make any changes to your process before you share?
	•  When you're giving instructions, meet people where they are.
	
	•  Find out how they learn. Place steps into buckets, provide support materials, and share the why behind a process. You will get better buy-in and faster learning in action.
